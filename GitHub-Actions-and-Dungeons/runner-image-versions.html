<h1>Attempt #2<br>Parallel build and image versions of <ruby>üèÉ<rp>(</rp><rt>runner</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>s</h1>
<p>It is always a good idea to build in parallel to finish a build faster. GitHub
Actions also allows you to run multiple jobs in parallel during a workflow. The
key is <a href="https://docs.github.com/ja/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds"><code>needs</code></a>. You can use it as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">jobs:
  job1:
    ‚ãÆ

  job2:
    ‚ãÆ

  job3:
    needs: [job1, job2]
    ‚ãÆ
</code></pre>
<p><code>job3</code> will start when both <code>job1</code> and <code>job2</code> are finished. Since <code>job1</code>, <code>job2</code>
and <code>job3</code> will run on different instances of the runner, <code>job1</code> and <code>job2</code> have
to store the build results with <code>actions/upload-artifact</code>, and <code>job3</code> should
retrieve them with <code>actions/download-artifact</code>. That is a typical approach to
running parallel jobs.</p>
<h2>Parallel build of libraries for iOS</h2>
<p>Here is a more practical example. The following <a href="https://github.com/maroontress/mimicssl-aes128-cbc-decrypt/blob/main/.github/workflows/ios.yml">workflow</a> builds a library as an xcframework for iOS, which decrypts data encrypted with AES 128-bit in CBC mode:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">jobs:
  build_non_fat:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    strategy:
      max-parallel: 3
      matrix:
        abi: [x86_64, arm64]
        sdk: [iphoneos, iphonesimulator]
        exclude:
          - abi: x86_64
            sdk: iphoneos
    steps:
      ‚ãÆ

  install_and_test:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    needs: build_non_fat
    steps:
      ‚ãÆ
</code></pre>
<p>When all <code>build_non_fat</code> jobs finish, the <code>install_and_test</code> job starts. The following is a visualization of the workflow:</p>
<div>
<a href="attempt2/Workflow-iOS.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="attempt2/Workflow-iOS.png"></a>
</div>
<p>The first <code>build_non_fat</code> job executes three jobs<sup><a href="#1">‚Ä†1</a></sup> in parallel in the following configurations:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">ABI</th>
<th style="text-align:left">SDK</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>x86_64</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>iphonesimulator</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>arm64</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>iphonesimulator</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>arm64</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><code>iphoneos</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is also possible to use CMake to create a <em>fat</em> library at once for the
<code>iphonesimulator</code> SDK that contains both <code>x86_64</code> and <code>arm64</code> ABIs. In that
case, we can reduce the number of jobs to two. However, since this project uses
assembler instructions (Intrinsics), the set of source files and compilation
options are different for each ABI. Therefore, the <code>build_non_fat</code> job has to
build the <em>non-fat</em> library separately. Each runner makes the <em>build directory</em>
containing the artifacts CMake builds and saves them with
<code>actions/upload-artifact</code>. The name of the build directory contains the ABI and
SDK, so downloading them in the next job will not conflict.</p>
<p>The second <code>install_and_test</code> job downloads all the artifacts of the build
directories with <code>actions/download-artifact</code> and performs the following
operations sequentially:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the iOS simulator with <code>xcrun</code> and test the non-fat library for the
<code>iphonesimulator</code> and <code>x86_64</code><sup><a href="#2">‚Ä†2</a></sup> with <code>ctest</code>.</li>
<li>Create the fat library for the <code>iphonesimulator</code> with <code>lipo</code>.</li>
<li>Create the xcframework with <code>xcodebuild</code>.</li>
<li>Install the xcframework, the non-fat library for <code>iphoneos</code>, the fat library
for <code>iphonesimulator</code>, and the header files.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is somewhat complicated, but there is no need to understand all the details.
We use shell scripts and CMake they execute to build. CMake runs not only in the
first jobs but also in the second job<sup><a href="#3">‚Ä†3</a></sup>, but it does not
create a build directory in the second job. The second job downloads the build
directories that the first jobs made, so it runs <code>ctest</code> and
<code>cmake --target install</code> on them, respectively.</p>
<p><a name="1"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä†1 The combination of <code>x86_64</code> and <code>iphoneos</code> is excluded by <code>exclude</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="2"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä†2 Due to using macOS runners with Intel architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="3"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä†3 We install the libraries (built in the first jobs) in a temporary
location with <code>cmake --target install</code> and then use <code>lipo</code> or <code>xcodebuild</code>
for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The <em>versions</em> of the runner image</h2>
<p>However, when running such a workflow file, the build sometimes fails. The
build failures occurred when executing <code>cmake</code> or <code>ctest</code> in the second job. Why
did builds fail?</p>
<p>The first part of the build log in GitHub Actions keeps information about the
runner. For example, if you expand the ‚ÄúSet up job‚Äù entry in any
build log, the following appears:</p>
<div>
<a href="attempt2/RunnerImage.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="attempt2/RunnerImage.png"></a>
</div>
<p>That shows the runner image is <code>macos-12</code>, the version is <code>20231216.1</code>, and
there are links about the image release. These links let us know what software
the maintainers installed and what changes they made in that runner. Image
releases are tagged, so it is easy to see how often the image is updated as
follows:</p>
<div>
<img style="width: 320px;" src="attempt2/Tags.png">
</div>
<p>It appears that there are updates about one to two weeks apart.</p>
<p>The README of that <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images">repository of runner images</a> contains the
following <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images?tab=readme-ov-file#available-images">list of the latest available images</a>:</p>
<div>
<a href="attempt2/AvailableImages.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="attempt2/AvailableImages.png"></a>
</div>
<p>There is a column titled <em>Rollout Progress of Latest Image Release</em> on the right
side of the table. This column shows the percentage of the latest version of the
image used. For example, if it is 100% for <code>macos-12</code>, it means all instances
use the same (latest) version of that image. Since all rows in the table above
are 100%, they were so that time.</p>
<p>However, it is not always 100% at all times. The following table is from another
day:</p>
<div>
<a href="attempt2/AvailableImages_20240111_1219.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="attempt2/AvailableImages_20240111_1219.png"></a>
</div>
<p>As shown in this image, for example, if the rollout progress is 9.79% for
<code>macos-12</code>, there is a 90.21% chance that the instance will use one previous
(older) version of the image. If the image version differs, the installed
compiler, toolchain, SDK, and so on might also have a different version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">‚òï</span></p>
<p>What about the probability that multiple instances will all have the same
version? For a runner with an image having 10% rollout progress and for two
instances, the probability is (1 ‚àí 0.1)<sup>2</sup> + 0.1<sup>2</sup> =
0.82, which is the sum of the probability that they are all the old version
and the probability that they are all the new version. For four instances, the
probability is (1 ‚àí 0.1)<sup>4</sup> + 0.1<sup>4</sup> = 0.6561 + 0.001
= 0.6562. The probability that all images in the instances are the same
version is about 2/3.</p>
</blockquote>

-->
<p>That is why the build failed. One of the multiple instances running in the build
was from an old image, and (unfortunately) the version of CMake was different
between that old image and the latest one. No wonder trying to test or install
with the new CMake and the build directory created by the old CMake does not
work.</p>
<p>The biggest problem was my assumption that the image of each runner would be
identical.</p>
<h2>Getting the version at runtime</h2>
<p>Now, how do I get the version of the image that is running the workflow? I
checked there is no documentation yet, but it seems to be
<a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/discussions/7661">obtained from the <code>ImageVersion</code> environment variable</a> as
follows:</p>
<div>
<a href="attempt2/ImageVersion.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="attempt2/ImageVersion.png"></a>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/maroontress/try_out_github_actions/actions/workflows/image-version.yml">View this workflow file on GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even if you get the image version, there's nothing you can do. Of course, it
is possible to ‚Äú<em>store the versions of the running images in the parallel
job, check them in the later job (the one that downloads the build directory, as
described in the previous section), and stop execution if they are not all the
same.</em>‚Äù However, as we saw earlier, the image is updated so often that it
is inconvenient for the CI to stop every time. Even so, in the previous example,
you should check the installed version of CMake, not the image version.</p>
<h2>Install the specified version of CMake</h2>
<p>CMake is not a huge tool, and there are binary distributions for Windows, Linux,
and macOS. Instead of using the preinstalled CMake in the image, how about
installing your favorite version of CMake yourself?</p>
<p>There is a third-party action available on the marketplace to install CMake. In
the first step of the workflow, try to install CMake by specifying the version
as follows:</p>
<div>
<a href="attempt2/get-cmake.png"><img style="width: 100%;" src="attempt2/get-cmake.png"></a>
</div>
<p>Now, even if different versions of the image mix, the error no longer occurs.</p>
<p>But there are other tools besides CMake that we depend on. What about Xcode, for
example? When it comes to something as big as Xcode, you don't want to install
it by specifying a version.
<a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-12-Readme.md#xcode">The Xcode versions installed on the current <code>macos-12</code> image</a>
are as follows:</p>
<div>
<img width="320px;" src="attempt2/Xcode.png">
</div>
<p>For example, if you want to specify the Xcode version by the value of the
<code>XCODE_VERSION</code> environment variable, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">    - name: Select Xcode
      run: sudo xcode-select -s &quot;/Applications/Xcode_${XCODE_VERSION}.app/Contents/Developer&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The specified version of Xcode may not be available via image updates, but the
frequency of such updates would be about once a year (based on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Xcode_11.0_-_14.x_(since_SwiftUI_framework)">the release of 13.1 in October 2021 and 14.2 in December 2022</a>).</p>
<h2>Finish the use of CMake in one job</h2>
<p>Another idea to keep in mind is to avoid using a tool <em>across</em> instances. In our
example above, this means that <em>the instance using CMake should complete its use
of CMake</em>. To do this, we will no longer transfer the build directory created by
CMake to the instance of the next job. Instead, we should <em>run the tests,
install the non-fat library in a temporary directory, and upload it</em> with the
first job in the same instance. Then we download all the non-fat libraries and
create the xcframework with the last job. The workflow file would look like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">jobs:
  build_non_fat:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    strategy:
      max-parallel: 3
      matrix:
        abi: [x86_64, arm64]
        sdk: [iphoneos, iphonesimulator]
        exclude:
          - abi: x86_64
            sdk: iphoneos
    steps:
      ‚ãÆ
    - name: Run simulator and then test
      if: ${{ matrix.sdk == 'iphonesimulator' &amp;&amp; matrix.abi == 'x86_64' }}
      run: |
        ‚ãÆ
        ctest --test-dir build/iphonesimulator-x86_64 -C $BUILD_TYPE
      ‚ãÆ
    - name: Install non fat files temporally
      run: |
        cmake --build build/${{matrix.sdk}}-${{matrix.abi}} --target install \
          $HOME/tmp ...
    - name: Archive artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: non-fat-files-${{matrix.sdk}}-${{matrix.abi}}
        path: ~/tmp
        if-no-files-found: error

  install:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    needs: build_non_fat
    steps:
      ‚ãÆ
    - name: Download artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      ‚ãÆ
    - name: Create xcframework
      ‚ãÆ
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, working with libraries built by the old compiler and with the new
compiler can lead to errors, but we should be aware that reducing the number of
fragmentation points will increase tolerance. If that's not possible, let's do
parallel builds with a self-hosted runner.</p>
