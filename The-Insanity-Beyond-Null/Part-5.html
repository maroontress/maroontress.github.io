<h1>5. Epilog</h1>
<p>It's just a matter of checking to see if a value is <code>null</code>, but humans can't do
it perfectly.  To overcome <em>a lapse of null checks</em>, we have seen various
improvements such as null object patterns, option types, nullable types, and
static analysis of the compilers.  But can you say with confidence that the
cost of introducing those complexities is worth the effect?</p>
<p>The book <em>Software Tools</em> [<a href="#ref1">1</a>] describes error handling as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Error checking interferes with readability, no question about it, but it is
necessary.  With the best of languages, error checking obscures the main flow
of events because the checks themselves impose a structure on the code which
is different from that which expresses the basic job to be done.  Programs
written from the start with well thought out error checks, however, prove to
be more reliable and live longer than those where the error checking is
pasted on as an afterthought.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you replace error checking with null checking, the situation doesn't seem to
have changed much over the past 40 years.  Of course, many languages are now
able to separate the structure of exception handling from that of normal
handling with mechanisms like throwing and catching exceptions.  However,
nothing has changed in terms of checking the return value in normal handling
and then performing something depending on the kind of the value.</p>
<p>There is also a significant difference in usability, in terms of the null
safety of programming languages, between one that has a trick added from the
middle version of the language and one that is endowed by nature with it.  The
null safety which is inborn is quite different from acquired.  To appropriate
the expression in [1], “Programming languages designed from the start
with well-thought-out null safety prove to be more reliable and live longer
than those where the null safety is pasted on as an afterthought.”</p>
<p>Finally, the debate about null safety seems like the old <em>goto</em>.  It will get
better anyway with removing goto.  Or a ghost of goto called <em>labeled break</em>
appears despite having buried goto.  Even if you conceal goto, the concept
never disappears.  It is the same for <code>null</code>.  The situation where you have at
most one value continues to exist with or without <code>null</code>.</p>
